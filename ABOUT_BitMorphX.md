## 👤 About BitMorphX – GitHub Profile

Hello! I am **BitMorphX** – an independent developer creating open-source tools for Bitcoin address analysis, key transformation, and in-depth blockchain structural research. Since 2013, I’ve been working with cryptocurrency technologies, diving into their architecture, security, and algorithmic efficiency. I also analyze Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and other networks.

For me, development is a path to deep understanding. All of my tools are **educational, ethical, and analytical**. I will **never publish** tools that could harm users or networks.

**BitMorphX** is not a name – it’s a structured and respectful approach to the blockchain world.


## 📂 My Project Collection (a gentle introduction to blockchain)

### 🔹 btc_address_sorter_by_type
A fast Bitcoin address sorter by format (P2PKH, P2SH, Bech32). Uses multi-core processing and shows real-time progress.

### 🔹 bitpeek
Address analysis tool: decodes Base58, calculates RIPEMD-160, verifies checksum, and shows entropy (CLI and Flask versions).

### 🔹 public_key_to_bitcoin_addresses
Converts an uncompressed public key (130 characters, starting with '04') into a compressed one (02/03 format), generates Base58Check addresses. Demonstrates the difference in conversion logic.

### 🔹 btc_batch_hex_checker
Experimental HEX key structure analyzer. Focuses on derivation logic, format conversion, and entropy distribution.

### 🔹 btc_key_converter / hex_to_wif_converter
HEX → WIF converters supporting both compressed and uncompressed private keys.

### 🔹 btc_entropy_visualizer
Entropy visualization tool. Displays character distribution and structural patterns.

### 🔹 btc_key_generator
A WIF format private key generator with correct prefixes – efficient for testing.


## 🛡️ ETHICS

**BitMorphX always follows ethical principles:**

- All tools are created for **educational and scientific purposes**.
- Tools that could be misused or are potentially harmful are **not publicly distributed**.
- Each project is **local and does not connect to third-party systems**.
- **No testing on real users' addresses without consent**.

This profile shares methodology – not an invitation to misuse. All public components are safe, and private ones are documented for research purposes only.

> "Ethics begin with responsibility, and BitMorphX chooses understanding over exploitation."

**⛐ Each user assumes full responsibility for any use of the tools.** BitMorphX accepts no liability for illegal or harmful actions performed using the provided code.

🔐 All public projects are MIT licensed. Built with respect for privacy and freedom. **Each user is solely responsible for how these tools are used.**


## 👤 Private Collection (projects not publicly shared for ethical reasons)

### 🔐 multi_chain_key_checker
Cross-chain address and HEX key analyzer for Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon. Checks key validity, generates addresses, and observes character distribution.

### 🔐 frag_btc_key
Specialized tool for reconstructing fragmented Bitcoin HEX keys. Operates fully locally without databases.

### 🔐 mnemonic_generator
Tool based on BIP39 generating 12-word mnemonic phrases and calculating BTC/ETH addresses using multiple BIP standards.

### 🔐 myther_ix_scanner
Ethereum network analyzer that scans public addresses to identify contract structures based on address patterns.

### 🔐 validate_pubkeys
Verifies the cryptographic validity of public keys and whether they can produce valid addresses. Used for validation and integrity checks.

### 🔐 extreme_ix
High-speed HEX → WIF and Ethereum address derivation tool for formatting and entropy experimentation.

### 🔐 vanity_rimped
Advanced RIPEMD-160 hash comparison tool that calculates % similarity between public keys, identifies stable character positions, and analyzes hash patterns.


## 🧬 My Research Direction

### 🔍 Origins (2010–2013)

**My research began by investigating vulnerabilities in early Bitcoin implementations:**

1. **Weak private keys** – reused or insecure sequences
2. **Incorrect BIP32/BIP44 paths** – repeatable or predictable addresses
3. **Public key reconstruction** – sometimes possible via scriptSig
4. **Overly exposed APIs** – insecure analytical capabilities

This led to the creation of **local, secure tools** for research and educational use.

**My tools now support:**
- address generation principles
- derivation path analysis (BIP32, BIP44, BIP49, BIP84)
- script analysis (e.g., scriptSig, asm)
- asynchronous data processing

**📈 Metrics used:**
- **Hamming distance** – for structural similarity
- **Levenshtein** – for typo tolerance testing
- **Euclidean algorithm** – for indexing and mathematical analysis
- **Heuristics** – for risk and cluster detection
- **Derivation path logic** – for structural wallet analysis

I also explore private key reconstruction using ECDSA parameters (`r`, `s`, `z`) and historical address conversion methods (`asm`, `scriptSig`).


## 🚀 QuantumChain (thinking beyond classical cryptography)

**Before we enter the quantum era, it's important to understand stable legacy systems.**

Example: **Bytecoin (BCN)** – the first CryptoNote-based network. Together with Monero (XMR), they serve as long-lasting examples of value and security.

**🔹 I also analyze:**
- CryptoNote coins (BCN, XMR)
- DAG networks (Nano, IOTA)
- Experimental blockchains with alternative derivation models

**QuantumChain** is a philosophy, not a product. It is based on:
- address structure,
- key reproducibility,
- script behavior,
- derivation integrity.
