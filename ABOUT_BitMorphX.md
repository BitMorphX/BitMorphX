# 👤 BitMorphX – GitHub Profile

Hello! I am **BitMorphX** – an independent developer creating open-source tools for Bitcoin address analysis, key transformation, and in-depth blockchain structural research. Since 2013, I’ve been working with cryptocurrency technologies, diving into their architecture, security, and algorithmic efficiency. I also analyze Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and other networks.

## 📂 My Project Collection (a gentle introduction to blockchain)

### 🔹 btc_address_sorter_by_type
A fast Bitcoin address sorter by format (P2PKH, P2SH, Bech32). Uses multi-core processing and real-time progress indicators.

### 🔹 bitpeek
An address analysis tool decoding Base58, calculating RIPEMD-160, verifying checksum, and visualizing entropy (CLI + Flask versions).

### 🔹 public_key_to_bitcoin_addresses
Converts an uncompressed public key (130 characters, starting with '04') into a compressed one (02/03 format), generating Base58Check addresses from both. Designed to demonstrate the difference in conversion logic, even though it doesn’t validate Bech32 or P2SH directly.

### 🔹 btc_batch_hex_checker
Experimental tool for analyzing HEX key structures. Focuses on derivation logic, format conversion, and entropy distribution — without checking balances.

### 🔹 btc_key_converter / hex_to_wif_converter
Tools to convert HEX → WIF with support for both compressed and uncompressed private keys.

### 🔹 btc_entropy_visualizer
Entropy visualization tool showing character distributions and structural patterns, useful for identifying weaknesses in key generation.

### 🔹 btc_key_generator
A valid WIF private key generator with proper prefixes and formatting — simple and efficient for testing.

## 🧠 My Research Focus

### 🔍 Origins of Analysis (2010–2013)

Initial research explored early vulnerabilities and poor implementations in Bitcoin systems. Some key issues discovered:

1. **Weak private keys** – users used repeated or insecure generators, compromising their wallets.
2. **Incorrect BIP32/BIP44 path handling** – some wallets misused derivation paths, creating repeatable or guessable addresses.
3. **Public key permutations** – recovery of public keys via scriptSig or other transaction fields was occasionally possible.
4. **Overexposed public APIs** – analytic endpoints sometimes leaked too much information.

These findings led me to build standalone, local-first tools for security research and education.

My tools now support:
- address generation principles,
- derivation path analysis (BIP32, BIP44, BIP49, BIP84),
- decoding and analyzing blockchain scripts (e.g., scriptSig, asm),
- asynchronous data processing pipelines.

Additionally, I incorporate:

- ✅ **Hamming distance** for structural similarity analysis
- ✅ **Levenshtein distance** for typos and reconstruction testing
- ✅ **Euclidean algorithm** for address indexing and cryptographic math
- ✅ **Heuristics** for entropy analysis, clustering, and risk estimation
- ✅ **Derivation path logic** to study structural predictability in wallets

I also research private key reconstruction via ECDSA parameters (`r`, `s`, `z`) and historical conversion of addresses via raw `asm` or `scriptSig` scripts.

## 🛰️ QuantumChain (a perspective beyond classical cryptography)

Before entering the quantum era, it’s important to understand and preserve today’s overlooked technologies. I support older networks that maintained value through principle — not hype.

Example: **Bytecoin (BCN)** — the first CryptoNote-based privacy chain. Networks like Bytecoin (BCN) and Monero (XMR) remain foundational examples of decentralized resilience.

I also research:
- CryptoNote-based privacy coins (BCN, XMR)
- DAG networks like Nano, IOTA
- Experimental blockchains with alternative derivation models

These are more than testbeds — they represent alternative ways of thinking beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.

QuantumChain isn’t a product — it’s a philosophy. One built around preemptive design for cryptographic survival, focusing on:
- address structure,
- key reproducibility,
- script behavior,
- derivation integrity.

Some of these foundations are already present in my current tools.

## 🧩 About BitMorphX

Development, to me, is a form of deep understanding. My tools are designed for **exploration**, **learning**, and **protection** — always ethical and educational.

I will **never publish** tools that can harm end users or compromise blockchain networks.

BitMorphX is not a name. It’s a lens — a structured and respectful way of seeing blockchain.
