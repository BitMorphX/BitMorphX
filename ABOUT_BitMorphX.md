## 👤 About BitMorphX – GitHub Profile

I am **BitMorphX** – an advanced independent researcher and developer specializing in open-source tools for Bitcoin key analysis, address derivation logic, and blockchain architecture exploration. With over a decade of experience (since 2013), I focus on cryptographic structure, key entropy, derivation patterns, and cross-chain validation logic across Bitcoin, Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, and other modern networks.

My work is driven by research precision, algorithmic transparency, and a deep respect for ethical boundaries in blockchain development. Every tool I publish is designed for educational, analytical, and secure research purposes. I do not release anything that could facilitate misuse or real-world harm.

**“BitMorphX” is not a pseudonym – it's a research philosophy.** It represents methodical analysis, cryptographic integrity, and a commitment to demystifying blockchain internals.

## 🧬 My Research Direction

### 🔍 Origins (2010–2013)

**My research began by investigating vulnerabilities in early Bitcoin implementations:**

1. **Weak private keys** – reused or insecure sequences  
2. **Incorrect BIP32/BIP44 paths** – repeatable or predictable addresses  
3. **Public key reconstruction** – sometimes possible via scriptSig  
4. **Overly exposed APIs** – insecure analytical capabilities

This led to the creation of **local, secure tools** for research and educational use.

**My tools now support:**
- address generation principles
- derivation path analysis (BIP32, BIP44, BIP49, BIP84)
- script analysis (e.g., scriptSig, asm)
- asynchronous data processing

**📈 Metrics used:**
- **Hamming distance** – for structural similarity
- **Levenshtein** – for typo tolerance testing
- **Euclidean algorithm** – for indexing and mathematical analysis
- **Heuristics** – for risk and cluster detection
- **Derivation path logic** – for structural wallet analysis

I also explore private key reconstruction using ECDSA parameters (`r`, `s`, `z`) and historical address conversion methods (`asm`, `scriptSig`).

## 🚀 QuantumChain (thinking beyond classical cryptography)

**Before we enter the quantum era, it's important to understand stable legacy systems.**

Example: **Bytecoin (BCN)** – the first CryptoNote-based network. Together with Monero (XMR), they serve as long-lasting examples of value and security.

**🔹 I also analyze:**
- CryptoNote coins (BCN, XMR)
- DAG networks (Nano, IOTA)
- Experimental blockchains with alternative derivation models

**QuantumChain** is a philosophy, not a product. It is based on:
- address structure,
- key reproducibility,
- script behavior,
- derivation integrity.
