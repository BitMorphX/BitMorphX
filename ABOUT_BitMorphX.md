## 👤 About BitMorphX – GitHub Profile

I am **BitMorphX** – an advanced independent researcher and developer specializing in open-source tools for Bitcoin key analysis, address derivation logic, and blockchain architecture exploration. Since 2013, I have focused on cryptographic structure, entropy modeling, derivation behavior, and cross-chain address logic across Bitcoin, Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, and other modern blockchain networks.

My work is guided by algorithmic transparency, deep structural insight, and a strict ethical framework. Every tool I publish is created for **educational**, **scientific**, and **analytical** purposes – with safeguards in place to prevent misuse. I do **not** release anything that could facilitate real-world harm.

**“BitMorphX” is not just a name – it’s a research philosophy.**  
It stands for clarity in cryptography, respect for blockchain architecture, and the pursuit of structural truth.

## 👁️ Vision

To illuminate blockchain internals and cryptographic structure through transparent, reproducible, and ethical research.

---

## 🔐 Core Principles

- **Ethics over Exploits**: Tools are built with safeguards; no real-user harm is ever acceptable.  
- **Privacy over Popularity**: I prioritize trust and integrity above fame or virality.  
- **Transparency in Logic**: Every algorithm can be inspected and verified.  
- **Offline by Default**: All tools are local unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## 🔬 Current Research Focus

BitMorphX has evolved beyond standalone tool development toward the systematic study of cryptographic keyspace behavior, entropy distribution, and structural properties of blockchain address generation.

Current research emphasizes controlled key mutations, similarity metrics, and the identification of non-random patterns within cryptographic systems — not to exploit them, but to understand their theoretical and practical boundaries.

This shift reflects a broader transition: from producing tools to questioning assumptions, modeling system behavior, and analyzing how cryptographic primitives respond to structured variation.

## 🧬 Research Direction

### 🔍 Origins (2010–2013)

I began analyzing flaws in early Bitcoin implementations:
- Weak private keys  
- Predictable BIP32/BIP44 paths  
- Public key recovery via scriptSig  
- Overexposed blockchain APIs

This evolved into a philosophy of **offline**, **secure**, and **structurally sound** blockchain research tools.

Current focus includes:
- Address generation logic  
- Derivation path validation (BIP32/44/49/84)  
- `asm` and script analysis  
- Public key entropy scoring  

**Metrics Used:**
- Hamming, Levenshtein, Euclidean distance  
- Entropy modeling  
- Heuristics & address clustering  
- ECDSA reconstruction logic (`r`, `s`, `z`)

---

## 🚀 QuantumChain (philosophy, not a product)

Before quantum disruption arrives, we must understand **legacy resilience**.  
I analyze:

- **CryptoNote** systems (Bytecoin, Monero)  
- **DAG** models (Nano, IOTA)  
- **Experimental derivation systems**

*QuantumChain* explores:
- Address reproducibility  
- Script and hash structure  
- Long-term keyspace entropy patterns
