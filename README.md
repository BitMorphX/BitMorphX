I'm an independent developer specializing in cryptographic research and blockchain forensics. Since 2013, I've been building open-source tools for:

🔍 Advanced Bitcoin address classification  
🔐 Public/private key transformation logic  
🧠 Structural blockchain analysis and entropy visualization  

I focus on low-level blockchain behavior — from raw HEX keys to full address derivation, working with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Solana, and other networks, including alternative and experimental architectures.

> I don’t build exploitative tools or anything designed for unauthorized access.  
> Every project I publish is meant to empower researchers, not attackers.

🧭 I create tools that uncover the cryptographic structure of decentralized networks, supporting security audits, educational research, and entropy pattern discovery.

🛠️ One of my key achievements is the development of **the first offline multi-chain key scanner** tailored for entropy-based anomaly detection — built entirely with security and research in mind.
