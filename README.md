# 👋 Welcome — I'm BitMorphX

I'm an independent developer specializing in cryptographic research and blockchain forensics. Since 2013, I've been building open-source tools for:

🔍 Advanced Bitcoin address classification  
🔐 Public/private key transformation logic  
🧠 Structural blockchain analysis and entropy visualization  

I focus on low-level blockchain behavior — from raw HEX keys to full address derivation, working with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Solana, and other networks, including alternative and experimental architectures.

### ⚙️ Research Domains

- Bitcoin address architecture (P2PKH / P2SH / Bech32)  
- Derivation path analysis: BIP32, BIP44, BIP49, BIP84  
- Entropy visualization and key validation logic  
- Levenshtein, Hamming, and Euclidean distance algorithms — for detecting similarity, mutations, and pattern deviation  
- ECDSA `r`, `s`, `z` parameter-based recovery modeling  
- Heuristic methods for clustering, entropy scoring, and anomaly detection  
- Experimental quantum-resilient models and threat pattern discovery  
- Conceptual foundation for **QuantumCore** — cryptography beyond classical limits
